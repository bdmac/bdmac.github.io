## Professional Life

By day I'm a professional grey-beard... a full-stack developer that hates
the term full-stack developers. I've been making dreams come true on
the interwebs for over 15 years but I'm no Al Gore.

I love small companies &mdash; what many refer to as startups although I'm
beginning to grow tired of that term. I've started a few of those and had one
(semi) successful exit.

While I still do a **lot** of coding and love the technical side of
things, my career has taken a decisive turn towards engineering leadership.

### Most Recently

I moved out to California back in 2013 to start
[Checkmate](http://www.checkmate.io) with some
[other](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pattersondrew/)
[fine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonymaggio/)
[folks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamrugel/). Together we set out to change
the ways hotels communicate with their guests.

I was the technical co-founder of the company and eventually went on to become
its CTO heading up a small team of 7 engineers in a company that at its peak hit
30+ employees.

Over the course of those three years.

We were acquired by [TrustYou](http://www.trustyou.com/) in mid-2016. No, I did
not win the startup lottery on this one but it was a fine outcome.

### How I Work

I like to be able to work in spaces where I can have a meaningful impact in very
short order. I also love learning. I started my career in online learning and
derive deep satisfaction from tackling problems in unfamiliar territory.

Hey, that's probably why I like startups so much!

I think the best way to be effective as an engineering leader is to help your
team learn and grow, be there for them when they need you, and always have
their backs. I read [@rands](https://twitter.com/rands) a lot.

Process-wise I like to think I practice informal lowercase-A agile. The formal
Agile tends to have too much pomp and ceremony for me. I normally look to
[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) for my story tracking needs
although I've never been one to settle and am always trying others out looking
for a better fit. Except JIRA...

Once it's time to make the sausage I follow a variant of GitHub Flow. I'll just
[let them explain](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) that.

### Tools of the Trade

I've been working on a Mac for as long as I can remember but fuck Apple, I'm
thinking about going back to Windows.

I tend to reach for the sharpest knife for any given job which at this point for
me tends to be Ruby for backend work and Javascript.

That said, I also really like [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and the
[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) web framework a **lot** and we put
them to great use at Checkmate.

## Personal Life

By night I'm a masked superhero known only as...

> DADDY!

I'm a husband to my wonderful wife Jossie (yes, it's Josie with two Ss, get
over it). Together we have an amazing little dude named William. He is named
after [William Riker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Riker) no matter
what anyone says.

I spend most of my free time in my personal life reading about things that are
important in my professional life which I guess is a good sign that I love what
I do. I'm a bit of a nerd. A bit of an introvert. A bit of a sci-fi fan
(seriously, how many more superhero TV shows can they make?). And a bit of a
novice drummer.
